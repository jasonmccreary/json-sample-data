# json-sample-data

Sample data for testing the JSON grammar. Currently simple. Eventually more complete.

## History

I needed JSON sample data for testing two libraries. [JSON.org](http://www.json.org) did not have a comphrehensive JSON example. The closest thing I found were limited [JSON examples](http://www.jsonexample.com).
